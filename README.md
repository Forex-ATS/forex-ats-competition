# Forex ATS Competition Platform

Forex ATS Competition Platform is an open innovation framework built around an automated foreign-exchange trading system. It encourages continuous improvement of the trading algorithm by hosting recurring competitions. Each competition invites developers to submit an improved version of the automated trading system.

## How it works

- A **copy trading service** replicates trades from the winning algorithm to a pool of users who choose to follow the strategy. A share of the profits generated by copy trading funds the prize pool for future competitions.
- When a competition opens, participants submit new versions of the algorithm. Each version is evaluated under strict conditions (e.g. risk management rules, drawdown limits, profitability targets).
- After the evaluation period, the best performing submission wins the cash prize. The winning algorithm is promoted as the new live strategy for copy trading.
- As the strategy improves, more users join the copy trading service. Higher profits generate larger prize pools, and competition criteria evolve to drive further innovation.

## Repository structure

This repository contains a simple website that explains the competition concept and provides a prototype interface for participants:

- `index.html` – The main page outlining the concept and linking to the competition rules.
- `style.css` – Styles for the website.
- `script.js` – Placeholder JavaScript to show how the platform might update competition status dynamically.

To view the website locally, clone this repository and open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Next steps

We plan to publish detailed rules, backtesting scripts, and live performance dashboards to support future competitions. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
